# General Algorithms Repo
This will be a repository of algorithms that are used in searching and sorting through data. I am using this as a showcase of knowledge, but also as a reference point back for review of concepts. I will be implementing the algorithms in Python and JavaScript (might do Java at a later point). This is just to show off the differences between the two and to showcase a better understanding of the concepts. Feel free to look through any of the ones you like, as well as use any you want in your own projects. You can find all of these online for free, but I will be commenting and explaining the algorithms along side my code.

# Search Algorithms

## Linear Search
The Linear Search is the most basic way to search through a list. All the function does is take a value to look for, and then iterate one by one through the whole list checking each value, until it finds what it is looking for. It has a O(n) time and space complexity.

## Binary Search
The Binary Search is a much faster way of searching through a list and is also more like how a human would search for something. It searches by going to a halfway point, checking for the value and whether is is less than or greater than the position it is at, and then halves the list, to then only check the half the value could be in. The same way as you might flip through a dictionary to find a word. The one downside is that it <b>MUST</b> be a sorted list. It has a O(log n) time and space complexity.
