# General Algorithms Repo
This will be a repository of algorithms that are used in searching and sorting through data. I am using this as a showcase of knowledge, but also as a reference point back for review of concepts. I will be implementing the algorithms in Python and JavaScript (might do Java at a later point). This is just to show off the differences between the two and to showcase a better understanding of the concepts. Feel free to look through any of the ones you like, as well as use any you want in your own projects. You can find all of these online for free, but I will be commenting and explaining the algorithms along side my code.
